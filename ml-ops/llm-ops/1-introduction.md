# Introduction to LLM-Ops

LLM-Ops encompasses the practices, methodologies, and tools needed to manage, deploy, and maintain Large Language Model applications throughout their lifecycle.

## Main Characteristics of LLMs

| Characteristic | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Pre-trained Models | Most LLMs come pre-trained on vast text corpora |
| Massive Parameters | Modern LLMs contain billions to trillions of parameters |
| Computational Requirements | Require significant hardware resources for training and inference |
| Unpredictability | Can produce inconsistent or unexpected outputs |
| Generalizability | Can adapt to various tasks without complete retraining |

## Historical Evolution

The field of LLM-Ops has evolved significantly:

- **Initial Approach**: Focus was primarily on operating the base LLM with minimal customization
- **Current Approach**: Integration of organizational data in the process, including data processing and manipulation steps

## LLM-Ops vs Traditional MLOps

| Aspect | LLM-Ops | Traditional MLOps |
|--------|---------|------------------|
| Model Size | Large (billions+ parameters) | Typically smaller |
| Data Type | Primarily text | Any structured or unstructured data |
| Pre-trained | Typically yes | Typically no |
| Model Improvement | Prompt engineering & fine-tuning | Feature engineering and model selection |
| Generalization | General-purpose | Fixed scope |
| Unpredictability | High | Low |
| Output | Primarily text | Task-specific |

## End-to-End LLM-Ops Lifecycle

The LLM-Ops lifecycle consists of several key phases:

1. **Ideation**: Understanding business requirements and setting project scope
   - Data sourcing and validation
   - Base model selection

2. **Development**: Adapting the LLM to specific use cases
   - Prompt engineering
   - Building chains and agents
   - Implementing RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)
   - Fine-tuning when necessary
   - Testing with appropriate metrics

3. **Operations**: Running LLM systems in production
   - Deployment strategies
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Cost management
   - Governance and security

Each of these phases presents unique challenges and considerations specific to LLMs, which we'll explore in detail in the subsequent sections.
