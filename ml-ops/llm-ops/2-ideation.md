# Ideation and Model Selection in LLM-Ops

The ideation phase involves understanding business requirements, data needs, and selecting appropriate base models for your LLM application.

## Understanding Business Requirements

Before selecting models or sourcing data, clearly define:

- Business objectives and success metrics
- Target audience and user needs
- Desired capabilities and limitations
- Compliance and regulatory constraints
- Resource constraints (budget, infrastructure, talent)

## Data Sourcing

Data is crucial for effective LLM integration, especially when building domain-specific applications.

### Data Sourcing Workflow

1. **Identifying Needs**:
   - What domain knowledge is required?
   - What examples would help the model understand the task?
   - What reference information should be available?

2. **Finding Sources**:
   - Internal knowledge bases, documentation, and databases
   - Public datasets relevant to the domain
   - Synthetic data generation for underrepresented scenarios

3. **Ensuring Accessibility**:
   - Data format standardization
   - Permission and privacy considerations
   - Versioning and cataloging

### Key Questions for Data Validation

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| Is the data relevant? | Ensures data matches the domain and use cases |
| Is the data available? | Confirms technical and legal availability |
| Does data meet standards? | Verifies quality, freshness, and coverage |

## Base Model Selection

Most LLM applications start with a pre-trained base model. Choosing the right one involves balancing several factors.

### Model Sources

#### Proprietary Models (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| Easy to set up and use | Requires exposing data (potential privacy issues) |
| Quality assurance | Limited customization options |
| Reliability, speed and availability | Ongoing usage costs |
| Continuous improvements | Vendor lock-in risk |

#### Open Source Models (Llama, Mistral, etc.)

| Advantages | Disadvantages |
|------------|---------------|
| In-house hosting (data privacy) | Support challenges |
| Transparency | Potentially higher maintenance needs |
| Full customizability | Limited commercial usage for some models |
| One-time cost | Infrastructure requirements |

### Selection Factors

#### Performance Considerations
- Response quality for target tasks
- Inference speed requirements
- Context window size needs

#### Model Characteristics
- Training data composition and biases
- Parameter count and efficiency
- Fine-tuning capabilities

#### Practical Considerations
- Licensing terms and restrictions
- Total cost of ownership
- Environmental impact
- Support and community

#### Secondary Factors
- Number of parameters (if relevant to task)
- Community popularity and ecosystem
- Documentation quality
- Future development roadmap

## Evaluation Process

To select the optimal base model:

1. Define clear evaluation criteria based on your use case
2. Prepare representative test cases from your domain
3. Benchmark multiple candidate models on these test cases
4. Consider both performance and operational factors
5. Prototype with top candidates before final selection

Thorough evaluation during ideation prevents costly pivots later in the development process.
